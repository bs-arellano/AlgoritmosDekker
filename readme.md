# Algoritmos Dekker
This repository contains a Python implementation of Dekker's algorithms for mutual exclusion. It also contains a PDF file that describes the algorithms in more detail.

## Description
Dekker's algorithms are a family of algorithms that can be used to ensure mutual exclusion in a system of two processes. The algorithms work by using two variables, flag and turn. The flag variable is used to indicate whether a process is requesting or holding the lock. The turn variable is used to indicate which process has the lock.

## Installation
To install the AlgoritmosDekker repository, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.

Once you have Python 3 installed, just clone the repository from GitHub.

## Usage
You can run each algorithm from src. The 'docs/Algoritmos de Dekker.pdf' file contains a guide of how each one woks.
